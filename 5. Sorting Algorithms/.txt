Sorting Algorithm: is used to rearrange a given array or list of elements in an order. For example, a given array [10, 20, 5, 2] becomes [2, 5, 10, 20] after sorting in increasing order and becomes [20, 10, 5, 2] after sorting in decreasing order.
There exist different sorting algorithms for different types of inputs, for example a binary array, a character array, an array with a large range of values or an array with many duplicates or a small vs large array.

The algorithms may also differ according to output requirements. For example, stable sorting (or maintains original order of equal elements) or not stable.

Sorting is provided in library implementation of most of the programming languages. These sorting functions typically are general purpose functions with flexibility of providing the expected sorting order (increasing or decreasing or by a specific key in case of objects).

Types of Sorting Techniques

There are various sorting algorithms are used in data structures. The following two types of sorting algorithms can be broadly classified:

Comparison-based: We compare the elements in a comparison-based sorting algorithm
Non-comparison-based: We do not compare the elements in a non-comparison-based sorting algorithm

Basics Sorting Algorithms:
1. Bubble Sort - O(n^2) Time and O(1) Space
2. Insertion Sort - O(n^2) Time and O(1) Space
3. Selection Sort - O(n^2) Time and O(1) Space
4. Counting Sort
